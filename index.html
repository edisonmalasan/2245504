            In my free time, I enjoy reading manhwa, and my absolute favorite is
            <strong>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</strong>. Its complex
            storytelling, unique world-building, and deep character
            development—especially the journey of Kim Dokja—have left a lasting
            impact on me. It's not just a story, but an experience that
            resonates with my love for immersive narratives and creative
            imagination.

              <p class="orv-intro-text">
                <strong>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</strong> is a Korean web novel and manhwa that tells the story of Kim Dokja, an ordinary office worker who is the only reader of a web novel called "Ways of Survival." When the world suddenly transforms into the setting of this novel, Kim Dokja finds himself in a unique position - he knows everything that will happen because he has read the entire story.
              </p>
              <p class="orv-intro-text">
                The story explores themes of fate, free will, and the power of stories. As Kim Dokja navigates through apocalyptic scenarios, he must use his knowledge to survive while trying to change the predetermined fate of the characters he has grown to love. The narrative is filled with complex characters, intricate plot twists, and philosophical questions about the nature of storytelling and reality.
              </p>
              <p class="orv-intro-text">
                What makes this story truly special is its meta-narrative approach - it's a story about reading stories, about how fiction can become reality, and about the relationship between readers and the worlds they immerse themselves in. The manhwa adaptation brings these elements to life with stunning artwork and masterful storytelling.
